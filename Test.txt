Writing a Research Article Begin your critique by identifying the article’s title, author(s), date of publication, and the name of the journal or other publication in which it appeared. In your introduction, you should also briefly describe the purpose and nature of the study and, if applicable, its theoretical framework (see Table 1). If the paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, consider the credibility of the publication in which it appeared and the credentials (and possible biases) of the researchers. 2. If you are reviewing a research study, organize the body of your critique according to the paper’s structure. See Table 1 for specific suggestions about questions to ask in critiquing the various elements of a research article. Start with a brief description and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the research design and methodology and then critically review the presentation and interpretation of the findings and the researchers’ conclusions. If the research topic is time sensitive, consider whether the data used in the study was sufficiently current. 3. Use headings to structure your critique. In each section, provide enough descriptive information so that your review will be clear to a reader who may not have read the study. 4. Aim for an objective, balanced, and well supported critique. Polit and Beck (2008) advise2 : a. Balance your analysis to include both strengths and weakness b. Justify your criticism by giving examples of the study’s weaknesses and strengths 5. Conclude your analysis by briefly summing up the strengths and weaknesses of the study and by assessing its contribution to the advancement of knowledge, theory, or practice. Consider suggesting research directions and methodological considerations for future researchers.3 6. Use past or present tense consistently whenever you refer to completed research. Check if your discipline has a preference. 7. Use a standard citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, or Chicago/Turabian) to format references in your critique, and be sure to cite page numbers for all quoted passages. Table 1: Elements of a Research Critique and Questions to Consider

Article Writing A title is absolutely necessary when writing an article, and should be a concise summary of the information which is going to follow in the article. In other words, the main topic of the article should be stated in the title. Stimulating the reader’s interest is also essential - if the title looks uninteresting, why would anyone read it? There are various ways to achieve this. For example, if you are writing a description of a place, using adjectives can enhance the attractiveness of the place, before the reader begins reading the article, e.g. “The Tranquillity and Peace of an Island that Time Forgot”. If the task involves proposing a solution to a problem or your opinion, and so on, you can address your audience directly, e.g. “What You Need to Do to Be Successful”, or use a question such as “Is Learning English Really Necessary Today?” for the title. In more formal articles, it is more common to just summarise the topic in a short statement, e.g. “Laughter Can Improve Our Health”. The title should not be too long and should mirror the style of the article - formal or informal. A realistic article should consist of: 1. an eye-catching title which attracts the readers’ attention and suggests the theme of the article. (Think about why you read a magazine or newspaper article recently - what made you read it?) Articles can also have subheadings before each paragraph. 2. an introduction which clearly defines the topic to be covered and keeps the reader’s attention. 3. the main body of two to five paragraphs in which the topic is further developed in detail. 4. the conclusion - summarising the topic or a final opinion, recommendation or comment. REMEMBER Before you begin writing it is important to consider: • where is the article going to appear - in a newspaper or magazine? • who are the intended readers - a specific group such as students or teenagers, or adults in general? • what is the aim of the article - to advise, suggest, inform, compare and contrast, describe, etc.? These three points are the deciding factors in the layout of your article, its style, language and level of formality. Determine the information you are going to use and organize your ideas carefully into paragraphs. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence. The article could be formal, semi-formal or informal, depending on your intended audience. Use vocabulary and descriptive language appropriate for the article. Linking words and expressions, and a variety of vocabulary will only improve your work and make it more interesting. DO NOT use over-personal or over-emotional language or simplistic vocabulary. DO NOT talk about yourself. You are writing for the general public, not a close circle of friends. Your opinions are only interesting to other people if you can make them amusing, justify them or explain them
